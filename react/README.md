The Add to Cart React Application is a simple e-commerce frontend built with ReactJS, designed to showcase a list of products fetched from the Fake Store API. It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, view cart contents, and remove items from the cart.

Key Features:


Product Listing: The app fetches product data from the Fake Store API and displays each product with its image, title, description, and price.
Add to Cart Functionality: Users can add products to a cart. If a product is already in the cart, an alert notifies the user.


Cart Modal: A modal shows all the items in the cart when the "Cart" button in the navbar is clicked. Each item in the cart includes an image, name, price, and a "Remove" button.

Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS, the app is responsive and works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
